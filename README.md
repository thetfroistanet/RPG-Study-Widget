   To play local sourced (If blocked by school or something)
just download and run the HTML file.

  To just play online, go to:
  https://thetfroistanet.github.io/RPG-Study-Widget/

  You wil have to manualy save and upload progress
before you close it but its just a simple, free 
way of keeping track of progress. 

Use it at school, The gym, For cleaning, and
have fun!

Thanks for downloading :)
